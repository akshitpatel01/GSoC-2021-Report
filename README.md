# Add logging support to Simulation Execution Manager (SEM)
This page summarizes the work done as part of Google Summer of Code 2021 with with the [ns-3](https://gitlab.com/nsnam) Network Simulator.

## Project Overview
Simulation Execution Manager (SEM) is a Python library to perform multiple ns-3 script executions, manage the results and collect them in processing-friendly data structures. SEM tries to hide as many of the tedious details about running a simulation campaign as possible, providing a clean interface that helps the user get all the way from optimized compilation of ns-3 to plotting.

### Initial status of SEM: 
At the time of starting this project, SEM did not provide an API or support for enabling logging in ns-3 simulations. Apart from this, SEM also did not have any support for visualization of ns-3 logs. Despite having no explicit support for logging, the users were still able to enable logging manually in their ns-3 scripts by using LogComponentEnable(). 

### Project Goal: 
The project aims to do the following:
- Add support for ns-3â€™s built-in logging to SEM. We aim to provide an API which enables users to select the log components and their respective log severity classes to enable while running ns-3 simulations using SEM. 
- Add an interactive dashboard with different filters to efficiently visualize the ns-3 logs. This dashboard API is independent to the SEM logging module and hence allows the users to pass in any ns-3 generated log file (i.e. the users can pass a log file generated directly from SEM or manually by ns-3). 

The Project was divided into four phases:
- **Phase 1**: Modify the existing run_missing_simulations API to add logging support in SEM along with tests and documentation of the functions added/modified.
- **Phase 2**: Add APIs to read, parse and filter logs from an ns-3 generated log file along with an API to insert the parsed logs to a TinyDB database instance.
- **Phase 3**: Build frontend as well as backend components for interactive dashboard.
- **Phase 4**: Add support for logging and accessing the dashboard from SEM-CLI. 

For detailed design and implementation of each phase please refer to the [Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GWQFEF1my4VmCnKayGZGYj6lwtYFQeE5qFI5emJlbOw/edit#).
